Because these are built into the browser, they affect every add-on available for Safari - and ours is of course no exception.  These limitations exist because it is not possible to get “deep” access to the Safari code, like we can with other browsers. Bottom line: there are some facets of Adblock Plus for Safari that cannot function optimally. For example, it is not possible to block ads in “third-party plugins” like video players or to block the so-called XHR requests. Usually this would mean that YouTube video ads cannot be blocked. But because of some very smart workarounds, Adblock Plus can block these annoying video ads in your Safari browser."
