Now you can select on which domain the rule should be active and which attributes of the element it should take into account (if the attributes you select are too common you might end up hiding useful elements as well). Preview will apply the resulting rule immediately to show you what the page will look like. If you want to create more advanced rules, you can switch to Advanced mode. Finally a click on \"Add filter rule\" will add the rule to your list of Adblock Plus filters and apply it to the current page."
