    "message": "The development of Adblock pretty much stopped in 2004. When more and more people demanded improvements Michael McDonald came up with Adblock Plus 0.5 — basically a version of Adblock with whitelisting, filter subscriptions and several other useful features."
  },
  "s3": {
    "message": "This version of Adblock Plus was still based on Adblock, which set hard limits to improvements. Quality of Adblock being... shall we say... less than adequate a complete rewrite was desperately needed. That came with Adblock Plus 0.6 — a completely new extension with focus on being easy to use, stable and secure. For various reasons many enhancements from Adblock Plus 0.5 didn't make it into the original release of Adblock Plus 0.6 but this changed with Adblock Plus 0.6.1."
  },
  "s4": {
    "message": "Michael McDonald, the developer of Adblock Plus 0.5, has changed to the Adblock project and is trying to develop it further now. For that reason starting with Adblock Plus 0.6 the main developer of Adblock Plus is me (Wladimir Palant)."

  },
  "s8": {
    "message": "Asking the user to make a decision isn't <em>in itself</em> a bad thing. Freedom of choice can be wonderful. People <em>love</em> to order espresso-based beverages at Starbucks because they get to make so many <em>choices</em>. Grande-half-caf-skim-mocha-Valencia-with-whip. Extra hot!"

    "message": "That doesn't mean that every single feature and customization option needs to be removed. But many of them are better off if they are not represented prominently in the user interface since most users won't need them."

    "message": "Why is it so difficult to add a keyboard shortcut for ...?"
  },
  "s14": {
    "message": "It isn't. However, keyboard shortcuts in the browser window are shared space. It is impossible to use simple shortcuts — those are already taken by the browser. And even the more complicated Ctrl+Shift+Something shortcuts are used by many extensions. The more shortcut keys we use, the more likely we are going to get conflicts with other extensions. You are free to <a>reconfigure the keyboard shortcuts</a> however."

Please include all the information we need to reproduce the bug: under which conditions does the bug occur, which browser did you use, what was the version of Adblock Plus? Also stay around for follow-up questions we might have and to confirm that the bug was really fixed."

If you want to contribute in this way please register on <a>BabelZilla</a>, go to the <a>Adblock Plus topic</a> and follow the \"View on WTS\" link in the first post. Claim any of the languages that don't have a translator assigned yet for yourself. Note that you should only do it if you are willing to update your translation for new Adblock Plus versions (BabelZilla will notify you whenever this becomes necessary). Read the <a>BabelZilla FAQ</a> to learn more about WTS (Web Translation System)."

    "message": "Forgive the misuse of this slogan but telling other people about Adblock Plus is also an appreciated contribution. While nobody profits directly from it, widespread adoption of ad blocking software will make intrusive ads economically inefficient until they become as rare as pop-up windows already are today. And aside of making the internet a better place it is simply good to know that this work is used."
