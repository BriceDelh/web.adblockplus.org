    "message": "Adblock Plus itself has no functionality, in the sense that it does not block anything until it is \"told\" what to do by its filter lists. These filter lists are essentially an extensive set of rules, which tell Adblock Plus which elements of websites to block. Besides blocking advertisements, filter lists can also be used to block <a>tracking</a> and <a>malware</a>."

Therefore, we have established <a>strict criteria</a> to identify Acceptable Ads: unobtrusive ones that don't need to be blocked. Websites that are willing to comply with these criteria can <a>apply</a> to have their ads added to the Acceptable Ads exception list, which will unblock them for most users. Note that if you don't want to see any ads, you will always be able to <a>opt out</a> of this."
