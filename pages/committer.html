title=Becoming a committer


<p>{{s1 Anyone can <a href="/en/contribute">contribute code</a> to any of our projects. But if you're contributing to a project on a regular basis, it makes sense to request commit access.}}</p>

<p>{{s2 To become a committer for a project, ask the <a href="/en/modules">module owner</a> responsible for it. Make sure to include the following:}}</p>

<ol>
  <li>{{s3 A list of your past contributions - the module owner will decide whether to grant you access based on those.}}</li>
  <li>{{s4 Your public SSH key.}}</li>
</ol>

<p>{{s5 Note that whether you're a committer or not, every change needs to be reviewed by the respective module owner.}}</p>

<p>{{s6 Also note that we will revoke commit access for anyone who has been inactive for a while. Just ask again if that happens to you.}}</p>
