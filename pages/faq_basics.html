<h2 id="blocking">{{s1 How do I block a banner?}}</h2>

<p>{{s2 You can right-click on any image or frame and choose &quot;Adblock&quot; from the context menu. This will open a dialog where you can tweak the new filter before adding. Feel free to replace parts of the banner's address by wildcards (* — the star symbol) to make the filter block other banners with similar addresses as well. For more information you can read <a href="filters">Writing Adblock Plus filters</a>.}}</p>

<h2 id="disable">{{s4 I sometimes want Adblock Plus to be disabled. How can I do this most easily?}}</h2>

<p>{{s5 You can click on the arrow of the Adblock Plus icon in the toolbar to bring up the menu. There you have the option to disable/reenable Adblock Plus. If this isn't fast enough, simply press the middle mouse button on this icon, it will also disable or reenable Adblock Plus.}}</p>

<p>{{s6 In the menu you also have the option to disable Adblock Plus on a certain page. It will add an exception rule like}} <code>{{s7 @@||adblockplus.org^$document}}</code> {{s8 to your list of filters. You can find more information on exception rules in <a href="filters#whitelist">Writing Adblock Plus filters</a>.}}</p>

<h2 id="hide-support">{{s10 Can I support my favorite website by downloading but hiding ads?}}</h2>

<p>{{s11 No. Most advertisers pay per-click, so if you hide ads, you won't actually support the site in question. Even in the off-chance of payouts per-view, it's trivial for advertisers to use JavaScript to check if the ads are visible. Additionally, downloading but hiding ads to trick advertisers into paying would be akin to fraud.}}</p>

<p>{{s12 In short, if you want to support your favorite websites, you'll have to whitelist them to disable Adblock Plus on those sites.}}</p>

<h2 id="objects">{{s35 The banner is an object (Flash or Java) and doesn't have a context menu. What now?}}</h2>

<p>{{s36 Adblock Plus has an option called "Show tabs on Flash and Java". When activated (the default) it will display a button saying "Block" at the upper right (lower right if there isn't enough space) corner of every object. Clicking this button will block the object.}}</p>

<animation label="{{s37 Show me how this is done}}" name="blockobject" xmlns="https://adblockplus.org/animation"></animation>

<p>{{s38 Alternatively you can open the list of blockable items (press Ctrl+Shift+V or click the dropdown arrow next to the ABP toolbar icon and choose Open blockable items) and look for an object there.}}</p>

<animation label="{{s39 Show me how this is done}}" name="blockobject2" xmlns="https://adblockplus.org/animation"></animation>

<p>{{s40 You can click the Type column header — this will sort the list by type and make finding objects easier.}}</p>

<h2 id="checking">{{s41 The list of blockable items shows many addresses. How do I know which one is the banner?}}</h2>

<p>{{s42 You can look for addresses that start differently than the address of the page you are viewing. Banners also typically have keywords like "banner" or "ad" in their address. Click an address to make the corresponding element(s) blink on the page (unfortunately this doesn't work for all types of objects). If you are still unsure, press the middle mouse button on the address to open it in a new tab — there you will definitely see whether it is a banner.}}</p>

<h2 id="ordering">{{s43 Is the order of filters relevant for performance?}}</h2>

<p>{{s44 No. When Adblock Plus tests an address against your list of filters it determines the best order in which filters should be tested automatically, in fact most of the filters won't be considered at all. The order of filters you can change in the Preferences dialog is for your convenience only, it has no impact on the performance.}}</p>

<h2 id="regexps">{{s45 Are regular expressions faster than "normal" filters?}}</h2>

<p>{{s46 Usually this is not the case. Adblock Plus will transform any "normal" filter into a regular expression, and internally it will work only with regular expressions — there is no difference between the filters}} <code>{{s47 banner}}</code> {{s48 and}} <code>{{s49 /banner/}}</code>{{s50 .}}</p>

<p>{{s51 Regular expressions are often used to "compress" the filters list and replace several filters by one regular expression. The rule of thumb says "fewer filters means faster" but it isn't always correct in this case. Complicated regular expressions require much time to be evaluated, it might be faster to use several simple ones.}}</p>

<p>{{s52 Regular expression give you more flexibility however, that's where their use is always justified. For example the regular expression}} <code>{{s53 /adv(?!ice)/}}</code> {{s54 will block}} <code>{{s55 adv}}</code> {{s56 and}} <code>{{s57 advert}}</code> {{s58 and}} <code>{{s59 advertisement}}</code> {{s60 but not}} <code>{{s61 advice}}</code>{{s62 -- something you couldn't have done with simple wildcards.}}</p>
